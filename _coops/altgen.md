Altgen is a young people's co-operative agency based in London. We are passionate about supporting our peers, to set up worker's co-operatives as a collaborative and empowering solution to fix our broken economy. Our aim is to re-imagine the future of work by creating a more equal, democratic, and sustainable economy today.

We are constantly experimenting with the co-operative model and principles, adapting this tried-and-tested form of collective organisation for the 21st century. We are always iterating and improving the way we collaborate, organise and communicate.
